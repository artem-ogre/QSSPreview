		<h4>Q: How do I use it?</h4>
		<ol>
			<li/>Specify .ui and .qss files
			<li/>Freely modify .ui and .qss files
			<li/>The result will be shown to you immidiately
			<li/>Finish work early and go for a beer!
		</ol>
		You can specify .ui and .qss files in any of the following ways:
		<ol>
			<li/>As command line arguments (order does not matter)
			<li/>Drag-and-drop one after another or both at a time
			<li/>Using open-file dialogs
			<li/>Re-open last used files
		</ol>
		Oh! And one more cool thing: if your .ui form is relying on a .qrc resource file, it will be dynamically loaded and added to the resources. So, for example, you can see how the QSS matches up with custom icons of your application.
