# Welcome to the QSSPreview wiki!
## Here is a short FAQ:

### Q: How do I use it?
1. Specify .ui and .qss files
1. Freely modify .ui and .qss files
1. The result will be shown to you immidiately
1. Finish work early and go for a beer!

You can specify .ui and .qss files in any of the following ways:

1. As command line arguments (order does not matter)
1. Drag-and-drop one after another or both at a time
1. Using open-file dialogs
1. Re-open last used files

Oh! And one more cool thing: if your .ui form is relying on a .qrc resource file, it will be dynamically loaded and added to the resources. So, for example, you can see how the QSS matches up with custom icons of your application.

### Q: What is the license? I would like to use the source codes.

QSSPreview is under the <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT software license</a>. You can use it as you wish, just don't forget to provide attribution back to me and don't hold me liable.
